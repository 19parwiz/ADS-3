# Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains Java implementations of two data structures:

1. MyHashTable: Implements a basic hash table using chaining for collision resolution.
   It provides methods for putting, getting, removing elements, checking for element existence,
   and printing the size of each bucket.

2. BST (Binary Search Tree): Implements a binary search tree with methods for putting, getting,
   and deleting nodes. It also includes an iterator for in-order traversal.
